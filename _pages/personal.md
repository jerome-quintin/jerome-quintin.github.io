Here are some of the things I do to keep a balanced life. Some of the things I like include sports, music, traveling, reading, and spending time with family and friends...

Physical activity plays an important role in my life, whether to stay healthy (physically and mentally) or just for pleasure. This goes hand in hand with the fact that I'm an outdoor lover. I'm especially a winter lover (["Mon pays, ce n'est pas un pays, c'est l'hiver"](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mon-pays)). I practice alpine skiing, telemark skiing, ski mountaineering, cross-country skiing, ice hockey, speed skating, figure skating, snowshoeing, road and trail running, road cycling, cross-country mountain biking, hiking, soccer, and tennis.

I play the violin and the drums, though not as much as I'd like to these days. However, I always listen to something while working. I've always liked classical music. My interest generally decreases in reversed chronological order, i.e., from contemporary to baroque, but I have many crushes from the modern and romantic periods. Besides, I like many genres of electronic music, often when it's instrumental and well orchestrated. Finally, my passion for the drums comes from rock and jazz.

Let me end by mentioning that I quite like coffee. I was inspired by another physicist, who gave ratings to various coffee shops and put that on his website. I will take the liberty of writing a top 3 of my own of the best coffee shops in the different cities/neighbourhoods I have had the chance to live in for a proper amount of time (thus having a more global appreciation of the coffee scene within that area):

**Sherbrooke**
1. Café Hubert St-Jean
2. Kaapeh Espresso
3. Brûlerie Faro

**Montréal (principalement sur le Plateau et au centre-ville)**
1. Dispatch Coffee (probably my second favourite ever!)
2. Pikolo Espresso Bar
3. Café Myriade

**Rive-Sud de Montréal**
1. N Latté (Longueuil)
2. Café Pistache (St-Lambert)
3. Saint Laurent Café (Boucherville)

**Berlin (all neighbourhoods)**
1. Five Elephant (Kreuzberg) -- probably my favourite ever!
2. The Barn (Mitte)
3. Bonanza Coffee (Prenzlauer Berg)

**Berlin (only within Charlottenburg)**
1. Giro Coffee Bar
2. Reeham Coffee
3. Impala Coffee

**Toronto (somewhat restricted to a very narrow geographical area)**
1. The Library Specialty Coffee
2. Carbonic Coffee
3. Thor Espresso Bar Queen West

**Kitchener/Waterloo**
