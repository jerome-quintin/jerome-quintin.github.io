Here are some of the things I do to keep a balanced life. Some of the things I like include sports, music, traveling, and spending time with familly and friends...

Physical activity plays an important role in my life, whether to stay healthy (physically and mentally) or just for pleasure. This goes hand in hand with the fact that I'm an outdoor lover. I'm especially a winter lover. I practice alpine skiing, telemark skiing, ski mountaineering, cross-country skiing, ice hockey, speed skating, figure skating, snowshoeing, road and trail running, road cycling, cross-country mountain biking, hiking, soccer, and tennis.

I play the violin and the drums, though not as much as I'd like to these days. However, I always listen to something while working. I've always liked classical music. My interest generally decreases in reversed chronological order, i.e., from contemporary to baroque, but I have many crushes from the modern and romantic periods. Besides, I like many genres of electronic music, often when it's instrumental and well orchestrated. Finally, my passion for the drums comes from rock and jazz.
