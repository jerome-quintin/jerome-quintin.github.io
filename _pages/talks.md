I generally prefer giving blackboard talks, but sometimes slides are simply better suited. Here is a list of selected talks and slides about various subjects.

- Online talk given during the workshop Physics of the Early Universe - An Online Precursor (organized at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences) on 01/09/2020 about my papers (1911.06040 and 2005.10844) on limiting curvature: slides. See also the presentation on YouTube below:

- Online talk given for the Quantum Aspects of Space-Time and Matter (QASTM) research forum on 30/04/2020 about bouncing cosmology (review talk): slides. See also the presentation on YouTube below:

- Talk given at the Harvard Institute for Theory and Computation (ITC Luncheon) on 13/09/2018 about my paper on black hole formation in a contracting universe: slides. See also the presentation on YouTube below:
