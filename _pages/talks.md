I generally prefer giving blackboard talks, but sometimes slides are simply better suited. Here is a list of selected talks and slides (in pseudorandom order...).

- Blackboard talk given in March 2023 for a Cosmology Group Meeting at the Perimeter Institute presenting work to appear on past singularities and extensions in inflation (the work in question is now online; see [arXiv:2305.01676](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01676)): [video](https://pirsa.org/23030102){: .btn .btn--info}
