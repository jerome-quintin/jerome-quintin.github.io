I generally prefer giving blackboard talks, but sometimes slides are simply better suited. Here is a list of selected talks and slides (to be updated).

- Online talk given for the [Copernicus Webinar and Colloquium Series](https://indico.cern.ch/event/936284/contributions/4579351/) on 25/10/2021 about [my paper on viscosity and anisotropies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11701): [slides](../assets/docs/Quintin_slides_Copernicus.pdf).

- Online talk given during the conference [Alternative Gravities and Fundamental Cosmology](https://indico.cern.ch/event/873762/) on 06/09/2021 about [my paper on the principle of finite amplitudes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05550): [slides](../assets/docs/slides_AltFunCosmo21_Quintin.pdf).
