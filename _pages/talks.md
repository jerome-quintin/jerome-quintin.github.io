I generally prefer giving blackboard talks, but sometimes slides are simply better suited. Here is a list of selected talks and slides (more to be added soon).

- Online talk given during the workshop [Physics of the Early Universe - An Online Precursor](https://www.icts.res.in/program/peu) (organized by the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences) on 01/09/2020 about my papers on limiting curvature (mainly [arXiv:1911.06040](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06040) and [arXiv:2005.10844](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10844)): [slides](../assets/docs/slides_ICTS_Jerome_Quintin.pdf).
